"""LLM-based request complexity classifier and model-tier router.

When ``auto_model_routing`` is enabled in the server config, incoming requests
are classified by a lightweight classifier call on the upstream backend and then
rewritten to one of three tiers before the main dispatch:

  trivial  →  haiku   (simple lookup, formatting, tiny edit)
  standard →  sonnet  (normal coding/explanation/debug)
  deep     →  opus    (architecture, large refactor, complex reasoning)

Any non-empty string model value is eligible for routing — ``sonnet``,
``opus``, ``haiku``, ``fable``, full Anthropic IDs, and 1m variants are all
rewritten to the corresponding short tier alias.  Missing, non-string, or
whitespace-only model values are forwarded unchanged.

The classifier call uses a synthetic, bounded summary of the request — never
the full system prompt, tool schemas, provider metadata, headers, or history.
Any classifier failure keeps the model as the original requested model
(fail-closed).

Long-context size floor
-----------------------
Before the classifier runs, a deterministic size floor checks an in-process
token estimate of the whole request (``estimate_input_tokens``), combined with
two session-aware signals supplied by the handler: the last response's measured
total context size and a per-session actual/estimate calibration ratio.  The
floor fires when ``max(round(estimate * ratio), session_context_tokens)`` meets
or exceeds ``config.auto_model_routing_long_context_threshold`` (0 disables); the
model is then forced to the long-context opus tier (``opus[1m]``) and a
``context-1m`` beta is injected, so a request near the 200K window is served by
the only model that can hold it.  The floor outranks the classifier and the
walk-back/session cache, and applies even to text-less continuation turns.  The
size estimate is a local computation and is never sent to the classifier, so the
bounded classifier-input invariant is preserved.

Internal sentinel key
---------------------
Classifier payloads carry ``_anthproxy_internal_classifier = True``.  The
mapper must strip this key before sending upstream.  ``route_model()`` no-ops
immediately on any payload that already carries the sentinel to prevent
recursive classification.  The key keeps the ``anthproxy`` spelling on purpose:
when ``upstream_base_url`` points at an anthproxy instance rather than
api.anthropic.com, that hop recognises the marker and suppresses its own
classification of our classifier traffic.

    If ``cached_session_tier`` is provided and the request's final_user_text
    came from a walk-back over prior messages (a text-less continuation turn),
    reuses the cached tier without calling the classifier.  This avoids
    misclassifying recovered boilerplate and saves a classifier call.

    The long-context size floor combines two session-aware signals with the
    per-request estimate: ``session_context_tokens`` (the last response's measured
    total context size, a lower bound on this turn's input) and
    ``session_estimate_ratio`` (a calibration factor correcting the estimator's
    undercount).  The floor fires when
    ``max(round(estimate * ratio), session_context_tokens) >= threshold``.  Both
    default to the identity (``0`` / ``1.0``), reproducing the estimate-only floor.

    Returns a ``ModelRoutingDecision`` describing the outcome for logging.
